# AngularM3DynamicTheme

A dynamic Material 3 theming engine for Angular applications, providing runtime color theme generation according to Material Design 3 specifications.

## Features

- Dynamic Theme Generation: Generate complete Material 3 themes at runtime
- Color Customization: Modify primary, secondary, tertiary, neutral, neutral variant, and error colors
- Material Design 3 Algorithms: Uses @material/material-color-utilities to implement proper Material 3 color generation
- Visual Theme Demonstration: Includes components to visualize color palettes and tokens
- Component Showcase: Features Material components with the dynamically generated theme applied

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
